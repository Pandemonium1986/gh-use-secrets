## About this lab

:warning: A grading script exists under `.github/workflows/grading.yml`. You do not need to use this workflow for any purpose and **altering its contents will affect the repository's ability to assess your lab and give feedback.**

:warning: This lab utilizes [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), which is free for public repositories and self-hosted runners, but may incur charges on private repositories. See _[About billing for GitHub Actions]_ to learn more.

:information_source: The use of GitHub actions also means that it may take the grading workflow a few seconds and sometimes minutes to run.

## Instructions

<!-- Specific instructions for your lab -->

Please complete the instructions below:

1. Create your own copy of this repository by using the [Use this template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template) button.

<!-- Add your steps below starting with step 2 -->

## Seeing your result

Your lab is graded automatically once you have completed the instructions. To see the result of your lab, <!-- specify expected Looking Glass display_type -->, <!-- specific place to look -->.

If the workflow failed, scroll down to the **Annotations** section to check what went wrong.

See _[Viewing workflow run history]_ if you need assistance.

## Troubleshooting

If the grading workflow does not automatically run after you complete the instructions, run the troubleshooter: in the **Actions** tab select the **Grading workflow**, click **Run workflow**, select the appropriate branch, and click the **Run workflow** button.

See _[Running a workflow on GitHub]_ if you need assistance.
